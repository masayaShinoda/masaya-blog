*This is an article aimed towards those who also grew up in single-parent households—with an emphasis on fatherless homes, as it is more prevalent than motherless homes. The usage of the words "you" and "we" is intended towards such people.*

## How to deal with the tendency to victimize oneself. 

Empirical data supports the proposition that kids do much better with two parents. In the United States, for example, studies have shown that 71% of high school dropouts, 63% of youth suicide, and 85% of the prison population grew up in fatherless homes. More often than not, people do much better with two parents, both mentally and economically. If you were not already aware of these facts already, after reading it you have a good chance of feeling sad, perplexed, and even injustice.

However, this is not to say that you can't succeed in life without two parents. In fact, there are plenty of people who grew up in single-parent households who are now hyper successful in their careers, or are living a fulfilling life after finding love. A quick internet search can give you an endless list of athletes, celebrities, entrepreneurs, and people from different walks of life who excel at what they do. 

I truly wish to encourage you to play the hand you were dealt to the best of your ability. Although I am in no position to judge, and do not know the specifics of, your current condition, I can say with a reasonable amount of certainty that there were many remarkable individuals in history, and the present day, who were under much worse circumstances when they were growing up. An inspirational example, [Ayaan Hirsi Ali](https://www.theahafoundation.org/ayaan-hirsi-ali-founder-of-the-aha-foundation/), fled Somalia in order to seek political asylum in Holland after being subjugated horrific treatment, and then worked her way up from being a janitor to serving as an elected member of the Dutch parliament.

## For those who grew up in single-parent households, what spheres of influence would they expose themselves to gain access to the knowledge that a good father figure would provide to them in the first place?  

 People who grew up in single parent households might not have the same luxuries as their traditional family counterparts when growing up, and maybe we're more likely to cause trouble and take risks, especially if you're a young adult—since there's only one person setting rules and giving advice. If so, you will have to seek guidance elsewhere. A good mother, to some degree, can provide this for her child. However, it is challenging for one parent to do the job of two, and it is temperamentally very difficult for women to make the shift from being merciful to disciplinary.
  
 Alternatively, you might be someone like me and grew up with an overprotective parent who's set up walls and barriers—that many times restrict your own ability to grow up and be useful—without another parent acting a counterbalance. If you're in such a situation, you have to find a way to voluntarily expose yourself to uncertainty and insecurity because it is not at all obvious the long term consequences of overprotectiveness.
 
 With fatherlessness, you could argue that people can find their missing guidance from friends. They generate the missing masculinity in a gang, but that's not so good because the odds of them presenting the negative aspects of masculinity—uncontrolled aggression and violence as a means to an end—are high. More often than not, they aren't even in the right position to exercise any authority over themselves.
 
 ## Is growing up with no father better than a bad father?
 
 > "While almost any man can father a child, there is so much more to the important role of being dad in a child's life" — [Dr. Gail Gross, child development and human behavior expoert.](https://www.huffpost.com/author/dr-gail-gross)

I won't be able to do this question justice, although it is very much worth asking.

If you did grow up with an abusive father (by your own definition), or has someone close to you who's been through similar, please do share your thoughts either by [email](mailto:masayashida@gmail.com) or by commenting below.
