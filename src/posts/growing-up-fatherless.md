For those who grew up in single-parent households, what spheres of influence would they expose themselves to gain access to the knowledge that a good father figure would provide to them in the first place.

To some degree, a good mother can provide that. Although it's hard for one person to be everything.

It's very difficult for women to make the shift from merciful to encouraging disciplinarian.

Kids who lack fathers: to some degree they can find that from friends. They generate the missing masculinity in a gang, but that's not so good because they're just stupid kids and they're not in the right position to exercise any authority over themselves
Empirical data supports the proposition that kids do much better with two parents

The world is a dismal place, and it is very difficult to be a courageous person unless you have your father in body and spirit to encourage you.

Fathers can encourage their children to have the best versions of themselves to emerge. 

Negative consequences of fatherlessness:  71% of high school dropouts, 40% more likely to repeat a grade, 75% of all adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers, 70% of juveniles, 80% of children that exhibit behavioral disorders, 63% of youth suicide, 85% of prison population.
