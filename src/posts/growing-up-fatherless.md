*This is an article aimed towards those who also grew up in single-parent households—with an emphasis on fatherless homes, as it is more prevalent than motherless homes. The usage of the words "you" and "we" is intended towards such people.*

## How to deal with the tendency to victimize oneself. 

Empirical data supports the proposition that kids do much better with two parents. In the United States, for example, studies have shown that 71% of high school dropouts, 63% of youth suicide, and 85% of the prison population grew up in fatherless homes. More often than not, people do much better with two parents, both mentally and economically. If you were not already aware of these facts already, after reading it you have a good chance of feeling sad, perplexed and even injustice.




However, this is not to say that you can't succeed in life without two parents. In fact, there are plenty of people who grew up in single-parent households who are now hyper successful in their careers, or are living a fulfilling life after finding love. A quick internet search can give you an endless list of athletes, celebrities, entrepreneurs, and people from different walks of life who excel at what they do. 

I truly wish to encourage you to play the hand you were dealt to the best of your ability. Although I am in no position to judge, and do not know the specifics of, your current condition, I can say with a reasonable amount of certainty that there were many remarkable individuals in history, and the present day, who were under much worse circumstances when they were growing up. An inspirational example, [Ayaan Hirsi Ali](https://www.theahafoundation.org/ayaan-hirsi-ali-founder-of-the-aha-foundation/), fled Somalia in order to seek political asylum in Holland after being subjugated horrific treatment, and then worked her way up from being a janitor to serving as an elected member of the Dutch parliament.

## For those who grew up in single-parent households, what spheres of influence would they expose themselves to gain access to the knowledge that a good father figure would provide to them in the first place?  

 People who grew up in single parent households might not have the same luxuries as their traditional family counterparts when growing up, and maybe we're more likely to cause trouble and take risks, especially if you're a young adult—since there's only one person setting rules and giving advice. If so, you will have to seek guidance elsewhere. A good mother, to some degree, can provide this for her child. However, it is challenging for one parent to do the job of two, and it is temperamentally very difficult for women to make the shift from being merciful to disciplinary.
  
 Alternatively, you might be someone like me and grew up with an overprotective parent who's set up walls and barriers—that many times restrict your own ability to grow up and be useful—without another parent acting a counterbalance. If you're in such a situation, you have to find a way to voluntarily expose yourself to uncertainty and insecurity because it is not at all obvious the long term consequences of overprotectiveness.
 
 With fatherlessness, you could argue that, people can find this masculine  that from friends. They generate the missing masculinity in a gang, but that's not so good because they're just stupid kids and they're not in the right position to exercise any authority over themselves

###*notes*

* Kids who lack fathers: to some degree they can find that from friends. They generate the missing masculinity in a gang, but that's not so good because they're just stupid kids and they're not in the right position to exercise any authority over themselves

* The world is a dismal place, and it is very difficult to be a courageous person unless you have your father in body and spirit to encourage you.

* Fathers can encourage their children to have the best versions of themselves to emerge. 

* Negative consequences of fatherlessness:  71% of high school dropouts, 40% more likely to repeat a grade, 75% of all adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers, 70% of juveniles, 80% of children that exhibit behavioral disorders, 63% of youth suicide, 85% of prison population.
