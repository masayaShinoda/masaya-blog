*This is an article aimed towards those who also grew up in single-parent households. The usage of the words "you" and "we" is intended towards such people.*

## How to deal with the curiosity and the tendency to victimize oneself. 

Empirical data supports the proposition that kids do much better with two parents. In the United States, for example, studies have shown that 71% of high school dropouts, 63% of youth suicide, and 85% of the prison population grew up in fatherless homes. More often than not, people do much better with two parents, both mentally and economically. If you were not already aware of these facts already, after reading it you have a good chance of feeling sad, perplexed and even injustice.

However, this is not to say that you can't succeed in life without two parents, there are plenty of people who grew up in single-parent households. I truly wish to encourage you to play the hand we were dealt.

Sure, some of us might not have the same luxuries as our traditional family counterparts, maybe we're even more likely to cause trouble and take risks—especially if you're a young adult—since there's only one person setting rules, and giving guidance. Alternatively, you might be someone like me and grew up with, by your own definition, an overprotective mother who's set up walls and barriers—that many times will restricts your own ability to grow up and be useful. If so, you have to find a way to voluntarily expose yourself to uncertainty and insecurity.



## For those who grew up in single-parent households, what spheres of influence would they expose themselves to gain access to the knowledge that a good father figure would provide to them in the first place?  

###*notes*

* For those who grew up in single-parent households, what spheres of influence would they expose themselves to gain access to the knowledge that a good father figure would provide to them in the first place.

* To some degree, a good mother can provide that. Although it's hard   for one person to be everything.

* It's very difficult for women to make the shift from merciful to encouraging disciplinarian.

* Kids who lack fathers: to some degree they can find that from friends. They generate the missing masculinity in a gang, but that's not so good because they're just stupid kids and they're not in the right position to exercise any authority over themselves

* The world is a dismal place, and it is very difficult to be a courageous person unless you have your father in body and spirit to encourage you.

* Fathers can encourage their children to have the best versions of themselves to emerge. 

* Negative consequences of fatherlessness:  71% of high school dropouts, 40% more likely to repeat a grade, 75% of all adolescent patients in chemical abuse centers, 70% of juveniles, 80% of children that exhibit behavioral disorders, 63% of youth suicide, 85% of prison population.
